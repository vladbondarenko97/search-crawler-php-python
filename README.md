# search-crawler
This project is a search crawler written in Python &amp; PHP that scans a page, adds it's description and title to the database, calculates it's "Page Rank", and moves on to the next links that are extracted from each visited URL. I ran this on my jailbroken iPod 4g back in the days, 4000 websites a night which usually ends with my iPod crashing.

Note, this script is not maintained any more, this used to be a project in 2013-2015.
